# Gemini Agent UI - Development Log

This file tracks the development process of the AI agent interface.

## Phase 1: Project Setup

- **Timestamp:** 2025-07-22
- **Action:** Initialized project structure with `backend` (Node.js) and `frontend` (React) directories.
- **Log:** Created base folders and this README to serve as a development log.

## Phase 2: Backend Setup (Node.js)

- **Timestamp:** 2025-07-22
- **Action:** Set up a basic Express server.
- **Log:** 
  - Initialized `package.json`.
  - Installed `express` and `cors`.
  - Created `index.js` with a mock `/api/chat` endpoint.
  - **Note:** The API currently returns a hardcoded, delayed response for development purposes.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development (React)

- **Timestamp:** 2025-07-22
- **Action:** Created the user interface for the chat agent.
- **Log:**
  - Initialized a standard React application using `create-react-app`.
  - Replaced the default `App.js` and `App.css` with a custom chat component.
  - The interface includes a message display area and a text input form.
  - Implemented API call to the backend's `/api/chat` endpoint.

## Phase 4: Authentication Feature

- **Timestamp:** 2025-07-22
- **Action:** Implemented a complete user authentication system.
- **Backend Log:**
  - Installed `jsonwebtoken` and `bcryptjs`.
  - Added `/api/register`, `/api/login`, `/api/forgot-password`, and `/api/reset-password` endpoints.
  - Implemented password hashing for security.
  - Protected the `/api/chat` endpoint with JWT-based authentication middleware.
  - **Note:** User data is stored in-memory and will be lost on server restart.
- **Frontend Log:**
  - Installed `react-router-dom` for page routing.
  - Created separate pages for Login, Register, Forgot Password, Reset Password, and the main Chat interface.
  - Implemented routing in `App.js` to handle navigation.
  - Added a basic `AuthContext` to manage login state across the application.
  - Updated UI with forms for authentication and new CSS styles.

## Phase 5: How to Run and Test

To run this project, you will need two separate terminal windows.

### 1. Run the Backend Server

- **Navigate to the backend directory:**
  ```bash
  cd gemini-agent-ui/backend
  ```
- **Start the server:**
  ```bash
  node index.js
  ```
- **Expected Output:** You should see the message: `Backend server with auth listening at http://localhost:3001`

### 2. Run the Frontend Application

- **Navigate to the frontend directory in a new terminal:**
  ```bash
  cd gemini-agent-ui/frontend
  ```
- **Start the React application:**
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- **Action:** This will automatically open a new tab in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You will be redirected to the login page.

### 3. How to Test

1.  **Register:**
    - On the login page, click the "Register here" link.
    - Enter a new username and password and click "Register".
    - You should see a success message and be redirected to the login page.
2.  **Login:**
    - Enter the credentials you just created and click "Login".
    - Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the main chat page (`/`).
3.  **Test Chat:**
    - Type a message and send it. The chat should work as before, but now it's authenticated.
4.  **Test Forgot Password (Optional):**
    - Go to the login page and click "Forgot Password?".
    - Enter the username you registered.
    - **Check the backend terminal console.** A reset token will be printed there (in a real app, this would be emailed).
    - You can now go to `/reset-password` and use that token to set a new password.
